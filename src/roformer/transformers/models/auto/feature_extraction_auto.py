        Instantiate one of the feature extractor classes of the library from a pretrained model vocabulary.

        The feature extractor class to instantiate is selected based on the :obj:`model_type` property of the config
        object (either passed as an argument or loaded from :obj:`pretrained_model_name_or_path` if possible), or when
        it's missing, by falling back to using pattern matching on :obj:`pretrained_model_name_or_path`:

        List options

        Params:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (:obj:`str` or :obj:`os.PathLike`):
                This can be either:

                - a string, the `model id` of a pretrained feature_extractor hosted inside a model repo on
                  huggingface.co. Valid model ids can be located at the root-level, like ``bert-base-uncased``, or
                  namespaced under a user or organization name, like ``dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased``.
                - a path to a `directory` containing a feature extractor file saved using the
                  :func:`~transformers.feature_extraction_utils.FeatureExtractionMixin.save_pretrained` method, e.g.,
                  ``./my_model_directory/``.
                - a path or url to a saved feature extractor JSON `file`, e.g.,
                  ``./my_model_directory/preprocessor_config.json``.
            cache_dir (:obj:`str` or :obj:`os.PathLike`, `optional`):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model feature extractor should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            force_download (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
                Whether or not to force to (re-)download the feature extractor files and override the cached versions
                if they exist.
            resume_download (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
                Whether or not to delete incompletely received file. Attempts to resume the download if such a file
                exists.
            proxies (:obj:`Dict[str, str]`, `optional`):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., :obj:`{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}.` The proxies are used on each request.
            use_auth_token (:obj:`str` or `bool`, `optional`):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If :obj:`True`, will use the token
                generated when running :obj:`transformers-cli login` (stored in :obj:`~/.huggingface`).
            revision(:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so ``revision`` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.
            return_unused_kwargs (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
                If :obj:`False`, then this function returns just the final feature extractor object. If :obj:`True`,
                then this functions returns a :obj:`Tuple(feature_extractor, unused_kwargs)` where `unused_kwargs` is a
                dictionary consisting of the key/value pairs whose keys are not feature extractor attributes: i.e., the
                part of ``kwargs`` which has not been used to update ``feature_extractor`` and is otherwise ignored.
            kwargs (:obj:`Dict[str, Any]`, `optional`):
                The values in kwargs of any keys which are feature extractor attributes will be used to override the
                loaded values. Behavior concerning key/value pairs whose keys are *not* feature extractor attributes is
                controlled by the ``return_unused_kwargs`` keyword parameter.

        .. note::

            Passing :obj:`use_auth_token=True` is required when you want to use a private model.

        Examples::

            >>> from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor

            >>> # Download feature extractor from huggingface.co and cache.
            >>> feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h')

            >>> # If feature extractor files are in a directory (e.g. feature extractor was saved using `save_pretrained('./test/saved_model/')`)
            >>> feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('./test/saved_model/')
