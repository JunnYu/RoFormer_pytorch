    Constructs a Speech2Text processor which wraps a Speech2Text feature extractor and a Speech2Text tokenizer into a
    single processor.

    :class:`~transformers.Speech2TextProcessor` offers all the functionalities of
    :class:`~transformers.Speech2TextFeatureExtractor` and :class:`~transformers.Speech2TextTokenizer`. See the
    :meth:`~transformers.Speech2TextProcessor.__call__` and :meth:`~transformers.Speech2TextProcessor.decode` for more
    information.

        feature_extractor (:obj:`Speech2TextFeatureExtractor`):
            An instance of :class:`~transformers.Speech2TextFeatureExtractor`. The feature extractor is a required
            input.
        tokenizer (:obj:`Speech2TextTokenizer`):
            An instance of :class:`~transformers.Speech2TextTokenizer`. The tokenizer is a required input.
